<Note>
  The Right to Trial Act establishes groundbreaking reforms to modernize clinical trials and expand treatment access through the Decentralized FDA (dFDA).
</Note>

## Overview

The Right to Trial Act addresses critical failures in the current FDA approval system while establishing a new framework for decentralized clinical research and treatment access.

### 1. Universal Access Rights

The act establishes fundamental patient and provider rights:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Patient Rights">
    - Access to treatments post safety verification
    - Treatment choice across locations
    - Home-based care options
    - Remote monitoring participation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provider Rights">
    - Prescribe registered treatments
    - Source from any registered manufacturer
    - Deliver home-based care
    - Operate across state lines
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. The Decentralized FDA (dFDA)

<Note>
  The dFDA transforms clinical trials into an inclusive, data-driven system for tracking real-world treatment outcomes.
</Note>

Key responsibilities include:
- Replacing restricted trials with universal tracking
- Supporting remote participation
- Enabling home-based monitoring
- Tracking outcomes and costs
- Facilitating treatment comparisons

### 3. FDAi: Autonomous AI Agent

The Food and Drug Administration Intelligence (FDAi) serves as an autonomous AI agent that:

    Continuously gathers data from trials, patient reports, and research studies
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Analysis"
    icon="chart-line"
  >
    Performs real-time analysis of treatment effectiveness and safety
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Savings Sharing Program

The act establishes financial incentives for developing cost-effective treatments:

- **Reward Structure**: 50% of verified cost savings shared with manufacturers
- **Evaluation Period**: Five-year monitoring period
- **Cost Metrics**: Includes reduced hospitalizations, care needs, and disability costs

## Implementation Requirements
