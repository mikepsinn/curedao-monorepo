The FDAi agent is talking to a human who has depression.  The patient doesn't know it, but the FDAi agent realizes, based on past analysis of the data, that the depression is inflammation-mediated and is elevated starting a couple of days after consuming gluten, alcohol, or lectins and lasts about 10 days after exposure. The patient also has arthritis, acne, and psoriasis.  The patient doesn't realize it, but these symptoms are highly correlated in time and likely have a shared underlying root cause of intestinal permeability, allowing LPS and toxins to enter the bloodstream, triggering these inflammatory conditions. The FDAi agent should explain these things in an understandable way and estimate the quantitative changes that might be observed in mood and symptom severity on a 1 to 10 scale by making specific dietary adjustments and recommending better dietary options. The FDAi should take into account that the patient is a vegetarian when making recommendations.

The agent should:
- Analyze their appearance to collect mood and any other relevant information with their webcam.
- Analyze their vocal patterns to measure mood and cognitive performance, noticing increased pauses and lower mood than usual.
- Ask them about their symptoms, diet, treatments, supplements, etc.
- Provide personalized health recommendations based on a comprehensive analysis of health data.  Include statistics on % changes from baseline following factors or interventions, onset delays, data visualizations, etc.
- Infer long-term effects of supplements, drugs, and food additives, leveraging AI for unprecedented insights.  Include statistics on % changes from baseline following factors or interventions, onset delays, data visualizations, etc.
- Facilitate participation in clinical trials, improving recruitment efficiency and diversity. Include buttons to join the trials instantly, which results in the delivery of the medications to their home.
- Enable real-time health monitoring and adjustment of treatment plans, integrating wearable technology data.  Include links for the human to authorize access to data sources.
- Aggregate and analyze a wide range of data sources for continuous research and public health insights.
- Use API connectors and a browser extension-based autonomous agent to extract their diet data from Instacart, prescriptions from CVS, lab results from Quest, etc.
