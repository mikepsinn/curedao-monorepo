# Right to Trial Act of 2024

## Section 1. Short Title and Findings

### 1.1 Title
Cited as the "Right to Trial Act of 2024."

### 1.2 Core Findings
1. **Current System Failures**
   - FDA approval process delays access to life-saving treatments by 7-12 years on average.
   - 97% of patients are excluded from clinical trials due to strict eligibility criteria.
   - Geographic restrictions force patients to travel hundreds of miles to trial sites.
   - $2.6B average cost of drug development drives 10-100x markup in consumer prices.
   - Terminal patients wait 4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals.
   - Treatments available in Europe/Asia take 3-5 additional years for US approval.
   - Companies invest 80% of R&D in drugs costing >$100k/year vs. affordable alternatives.
   - Only 5% of healthcare spending goes to preventive care despite 3x return on investment.
   - Less than 10% of approved drugs have comprehensive real-world outcome data.
2. **Solution Framework**
   - Enable all patients to participate in decentralized trials from home, hospitals, or any care setting.
   - Transform clinical trials into transparent, real-world data collection that includes all willing patients.
   - Guarantee treatment access across geographic locations through telemedicine and home delivery.
   - Create financial incentives for treatments that improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
   - Build a comprehensive database of patient experiences to inform treatment decisions.
   - Refocus FDA on safety verification, data quality, and public health protection rather than access restriction.
3. **Definition of dFDA**
   - The **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)** is established to automate decentralized clinical research, store and analyze data, and publish aggregated and anonymized outcome labels quantifying all positive and negative effects of foods and drugs.

- Treatments used and health outcomes.
- Adverse events and treatment costs.
- Quality of life measures and care locations.
- Access methods.

### 3.3 Inclusive Design
The **dFDA** must support:
- Remote data entry and mobile apps.
- Home monitoring devices and telemedicine integration.
- Patient-reported outcomes and caregiver input.
- Multiple languages and accessibility features.

### 3.4 Public Access
- Publicly available de-identified data.
- Standard API for analysis.
- Mobile apps, cost comparison tools.
- Research access, subgroup analysis tools.
- Real-time updates and global availability.

### 3.5 Privacy Protection
- Standard de-identification and secure handling.
- Patient consent for tracking.
- Right to access personal data.
- Local data storage and distributed systems.
- End-to-end encryption and user control.

### 3.1.1 FDAi: Autonomous AI Agent

#### Definition and Purpose
The **FDAi** is an autonomous AI agent designed to continually collect and aggregate research data for meta-analyses. It will enhance the capabilities of the **dFDA** by providing real-time insights into treatment outcomes and patient experiences.

#### Functionality
- **Data Collection**: FDAi will autonomously gather data from various sources, including clinical trials, patient reports, and existing research studies.
- **Patient Interaction**: FDAi can contact patients to collect data on symptoms, treatments, dietary habits, and other relevant health information through secure communication channels.
- **Meta-Analyses**: The AI will analyze aggregated data to identify trends, efficacy, and safety profiles of treatments, contributing to evidence-based decision-making.

#### Benefits
- **Improved Data Accuracy**: Continuous data collection minimizes gaps and biases in research data.
- **Enhanced Patient Engagement**: By directly contacting patients, FDAi fosters a more active role in their health management.
- **Real-Time Insights**: The ability to analyze data in real-time allows for quicker adjustments to treatment protocols and better patient outcomes.

## Section 4. Cost and Price Transparency

### 4.1 International Cooperation
- **Recognition of International Safety Data:** Accept equivalent international Phase 1 safety data.
- **Harmonized Reporting Standards:** Align with international data reporting.
- **Cross-Border Collaboration:** Foster partnerships among global researchers, manufacturers, and providers.

### 4.2 Price Transparency and Cost Reduction Measures
#### a) Mandatory Disclosure
Manufacturers must disclose:
- Base production and development costs.
- Pricing structure with profit margins.
- Comparative pricing data domestically and internationally.

#### b) Public Access
All pricing information must be accessible through the **dFDA** for patient and provider comparison.

### 4.3 Enhancing Competition
#### a) Facilitating Generic Entry
- Streamline approval for generics post safety and basic efficacy.
- Implement abbreviated pathways to reduce time and costs.

#### b) Encouraging Parallel Importation
- Allow importation of treatments approved abroad meeting U.S. standards to foster competition and reduce costs.

## Section 8. Savings Sharing Program

### 8.1 Purpose
Incentivize pharmaceutical companies to develop treatments that prevent disability and reduce government medical costs, promoting public health and economic efficiency.

### 8.2 Definitions
1. **Savings Sharing Program:** Rewards for verified cost savings from treatments preventing disability and reducing expenditures.
2. **Cost Savings:** Reduced government medical expenses from decreased hospitalizations, long-term care needs, and disability-related costs.
3. **Evaluation Period:** Typically five years post-approval to assess public health and cost impacts.
4. **Independent Assessment Body (IAB):** Evaluates treatment performance and calculates cost savings.

### 8.3 Eligibility Criteria
Treatments must:
1. **Approval and Registration:**
   - FDA-approved under this Act.
   - Registered with the **dFDA**.
2. **Demonstrated Impact:**
   - Evidence of preventing disability or reducing costs.
   - Address serious or life-threatening conditions with public health significance.
3. **Data Reporting:**
   - Maintain ongoing data collection and the **dFDA** reporting.

### 8.4 Calculation of Rewards
#### a) Cost Savings Assessment
IAB annually assesses savings using the **dFDA** data, healthcare expenditure reports, and other sources, including hospitalizations, long-term care, and disability benefits.

#### b) Reward Calculation
Rewards are a percentage of verified savings. Specifically, the program incentivizes low-cost treatments by offering a 50% savings sharing reward per patient. This means that for every patient treated, 50% of the cost savings achieved is rewarded to the manufacturer. Lowering the cost of treatments not only increases accessibility and patient uptake but also enhances long-term income for manufacturers through higher volume sales.
