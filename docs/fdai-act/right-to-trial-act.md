   * Patients suffer and die waiting for approvals.  
   * Innovation happens globally but access is restricted locally.  
   * Companies are rewarded for expensive treatments over affordable ones.  
   * Prevention is worth less than treatment.  
   * Real-world outcomes are ignored.  
2. **Solution Framework**  
   * Give all patients the right to participate in decentralized clinical trials.  
   * Replace restricted trials with inclusive public outcome tracking.  
   * Enable treatment access wherever patients are.  
   * Reward both better outcomes AND lower costs.

# Why this hasn't been done

Implementing a program like the Health Savings Dividend might seem straightforward, but several real-world complexities have likely prevented it from being adopted on a large scale. Here are some of the primary barriers:

1. **Complexities in Cost Attribution and Savings Verification**

   - **Challenge:** Accurately attributing long-term healthcare savings to specific treatments is challenging due to the many factors affecting a patient’s health (e.g., lifestyle, other medications, genetic factors).
   - **Solution in the Dividend Model:** A global Treatment Outcomes Database (TOD) would address this by gathering and analyzing standardized outcome data, but building and maintaining such a database requires extensive coordination, funding, and ongoing commitment.

2. **Incentive Misalignment in Current Healthcare Structures**

   - **Challenge:** The current healthcare system often prioritizes short-term profitability over long-term savings. Pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and providers may not be incentivized to develop or distribute affordable, preventative treatments if these don't provide immediate returns.
   - **Solution in the Dividend Model:** By rewarding companies with a share of net healthcare savings, this model would realign incentives toward affordable treatments that offer long-term health benefits, although shifting entrenched business practices and financial incentives would still take time.

3. **Complexity of Regulatory and Policy Change**

   - **Challenge:** Implementing systemic changes like the Health Savings Dividend would require regulatory updates and new legislation, which can be a lengthy process, especially given competing interests in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors.
   - **Solution in the Dividend Model:** Clear legislation outlining dividend structures, funding for TOD development, and pilot programs could incrementally introduce this model. However, overcoming regulatory inertia would require political will and collaboration across sectors.

4. **Pharmaceutical Revenue Models and Pricing Practices**

   - **Challenge:** Pharmaceutical companies rely on high prices to recover R&D costs, especially in the U.S. where drug prices are significantly higher than in other countries. A model encouraging lower prices challenges this traditional revenue approach.
   - **Solution in the Dividend Model:** By allowing companies to earn dividends based on the long-term healthcare savings their treatments generate, the model provides a lucrative alternative revenue stream, but it requires a shift in pricing strategies and financial forecasting that some companies may resist.

5. **Data Infrastructure and Privacy Concerns**

   - **Challenge:** A robust, privacy-compliant data infrastructure like the TOD would require significant investment and rigorous data protection to safeguard patient information. Building such a system also requires buy-in from healthcare providers, insurers, and patients.
   - **Solution in the Dividend Model:** Investment in secure, de-identified data protocols and clear privacy protections would be essential, and making this data-sharing model optional but incentivized could encourage gradual adoption.

6. **Uncertainty in Predicting Long-Term Savings**

   - **Challenge:** Unlike traditional revenue models, long-term savings predictions can be uncertain, and companies may be wary of relying on dividend payouts tied to savings estimates rather than guaranteed sales revenue.
   - **Solution in the Dividend Model:** Pilot programs, possibly government-backed, could provide a demonstration of the dividend model's reliability, helping to build trust and encourage industry participation.

---

**Why It’s Worth Exploring Now**

Despite these challenges, the Health Savings Dividend model could be increasingly feasible as data infrastructure improves and the need for cost-effective healthcare solutions grows. With advancements in data analytics, machine learning, and secure data-sharing protocols, we are closer than ever to being able to accurately track and reward long-term healthcare savings.

In summary, while structural and practical barriers have likely prevented this kind of model from being adopted widely, recent advances in health data analytics and a shift toward value-based care could make it a viable solution to rising healthcare costs. Pilot programs or public-private partnerships could offer a path forward, demonstrating the model’s potential and building momentum for broader adoption.
