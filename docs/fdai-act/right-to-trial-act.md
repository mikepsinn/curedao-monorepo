## Section 8. Savings Sharing Program

### 8.1 Purpose
Incentivize pharmaceutical companies to develop treatments that prevent disability and reduce government medical costs, promoting public health and economic efficiency.

### 8.2 Definitions
1. **Savings Sharing Program:** Rewards for verified cost savings from treatments preventing disability and reducing expenditures.
2. **Cost Savings:** Reduced government medical expenses from decreased hospitalizations, long-term care needs, and disability-related costs.
3. **Evaluation Period:** Typically five years post-approval to assess public health and cost impacts.
4. **Independent Assessment Body (IAB):** Evaluates treatment performance and calculates cost savings.

### 8.3 Eligibility Criteria
Treatments must:
1. **Approval and Registration:**
   - FDA-approved under this Act.
   - Registered with the **dFDA**.

### 8.4 Calculation of Rewards
#### a) Cost Savings Assessment
IAB annually assesses savings using the **dFDA** data, healthcare expenditure reports, and other sources, including hospitalizations, long-term care, and disability benefits.

#### b) Reward Calculation
Rewards are a percentage of verified savings, determined via competitive bidding, capped at 20% of total verified savings during the Evaluation Period. Specifically, the program incentivizes low-cost treatments by offering a 50% savings sharing reward per patient. This means that for every patient treated, 50% of the cost savings achieved is rewarded to the manufacturer. Lowering the cost of treatments not only increases accessibility and patient uptake but also enhances long-term income for manufacturers through higher volume sales.

#### c) Cap on Total Rewards
Annual allocation capped by Congress, adjusted for inflation and healthcare cost trends.

### 8.5 Award Distribution
#### a) Timing
Annual distribution post Evaluation Period completion.

#### b) Process
Companies submit detailed impact reports; IAB verifies data and calculates rewards based on criteria.

#### c) Public Disclosure
Rewards and corresponding treatments publicly disclosed for transparency.

### 8.6 Oversight and Compliance
#### a) Independent Oversight
IOC monitors reward process integrity, ensuring unbiased assessments and preventing conflicts of interest.

#### b) Audit and Review
Regular audits verify cost savings calculations and reward allocations.

#### c) Penalties for Misrepresentation
Disqualification, fines, and legal action for data falsification or misrepresentation of treatment impacts.

### 8.7 Funding for the Savings Sharing Program
#### a) Source of Funds
Funded through the **Healthcare Savings Sharing Reward Fund (HSSR)** via congressional appropriation.

#### b) Allocation
HSSR funds exclusively for rewards, ensuring direct incentives for cost-saving treatments.

### 8.8 Reporting and Transparency
