# Benefits of Personal FDAi Agents

Nearly a million people commit suicide every year. Around two billion people suffer from chronic diseases like fibromyalgia, depression, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and more. 

Much of this suffering can be tied to poor diets and exposure to thousands of untested chemicals that disrupt the microbiome, causing downstream health effects like mental illness, neuroinflammation, dementia, and more. There's evidence that since the 1990s, when glyphosate usage has correlated perfectly with an increase in the hospital discharge records for many of these chronic conditions. Glyphosate, originally patented as an antibiotic, kills beneficial gut bacteria, allowing harmful bacteria to thrive.  However, there are hundreds other common additives that could be producing similar effects.  Shockingly, we simply have almost no long term data on any of them.

It's extremely expensive to run clinical trials on all these chemicals and additives, costing over $50,000 per person. I tried building a robot to collect longitudinal symptom data cheaply and determine how foods, drugs, and chemicals affect individuals. However, the robot is pretty basic. Here's what it looks like:

Ideally, we could gather data from thousands of people into a resource like Clinipedia to show how exposures typically impact symptoms. This would be more useful than standard nutrition labels. The challenge is getting enough people to contribute their data.

# Proposal

We need a way to harness people's data like advertisers do, and provide it to the FDA, so they can understand long-term, personalized effects of exposures.

# Clinical Trials of Experimental Drugs

We should make it easy for people to join clinical trials. Of the 2 billion suffering from chronic conditions, none should have to go a single day without the best available treatment. If standard care doesn't help, the robot should match them to the most promising clinical trial and provide the intervention at no cost. This would dramatically accelerate research progress.

I propose governments around the world work together to build this open source robot. It may cost around $1 billion - less than the price of a bottle of water that people mindlessly consume. If everyone chips in $1 we can fund the smartest robotics engineer to build this bot. Even if it only speeds up disease cure discoveries by one day, that's avoiding 32 billion hours of suffering.

Please provide feedback on how governments can collaborate on this initiative. Also recommend top robotics engineers who could lead the development. With your help, we can create a revolutionary technology to reduce global suffering.
